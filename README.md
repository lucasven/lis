# Lis

A production-grade AI assistant that lives where you already chat. Not a wrapper around an API — a full agent with tools, memory, security, cost control, and group intelligence.

## Why Lis?

Projects like [OpenClaw](https://github.com/nichochar/openclaw) offer impressive breadth — 25 channels, 15+ providers, mobile apps. But they lack depth where it matters for daily use: no prompt caching (every turn pays full token cost), no per-message cost tracking, no runtime config editing, no crash-safe message queue, no session resume by topic, and memory stored in markdown files instead of a queryable database.

Lis takes the opposite approach. It goes deep on the things that make an AI assistant actually usable as a daily driver:

**Cost as architecture, not afterthought.** Four prompt cache breakpoints keep Anthropic cache hit rates high — the difference between $3/day and $0.30/day. Two-stage context compaction uses a cheap model (Haiku) for summarization while the main model handles conversation. Per-message token tracking means you always know exactly what you're spending. Tool output pruning silently strips verbose results before they bloat your context window.

**Mistrust by design.** Five independent security layers gate every interaction: who can talk, what tools are visible, who can invoke them, whether shell commands need human approval, and whether file paths stay in the sandbox. Non-owners can see sensitive tools but can't execute them. Approval flows use WhatsApp reactions (👍 once, ✅ always, ❌ deny) for a native UX.

**Built for real messaging.** Message debouncing batches rapid messages. A crash-safe queue persists unprocessed messages in PostgreSQL. Typing indicators show the AI is thinking. Clock reactions mark queued messages. The AI sends incremental progress during multi-tool tasks instead of making you wait for everything to finish. Runtime config editing means you tune the AI mid-conversation — no restarts, no config files.

### Lis vs OpenClaw

| Capability | Lis | OpenClaw |
|-----------|-----|----------|
| **Prompt caching** | 4 cache breakpoints, real-time hit % tracking | None — every turn pays full token cost |
| **Context compaction** | Two-stage (tool pruning + summary) with separate cheap model | Single-stage summary, no separate model |
| **Per-message cost tracking** | Input, output, cache read, cache creation per message | No per-message tracking |
| **Tool summarization policies** | Per-tool `Prune` / `Summarize` control | No per-tool policy |
| **Session resume** | `/resume` by ID or semantic search (pgvector) | No equivalent |
| **Memory storage** | PostgreSQL + pgvector with CRUD tools | Markdown files (not queryable) |
| **Runtime config editing** | Change any setting mid-conversation via tools | Requires config file edit + restart |
| **Prompt section editing** | AI can view and modify its own system prompt at runtime | No runtime prompt editing |
| **Agent switching per chat** | `/agent coding` to switch tools mid-conversation | Agents routed at gateway level, not per-turn |
| **Message queue** | Crash-safe, persisted in PostgreSQL | In-memory only, lost on crash |
| **Message debounce UX** | 🕐 reaction on queued messages, typing resets timer | Silent internal queue, no user feedback |
| **Response directives** | `[QUOTE]`, `NO_RESPONSE`, react by message ID | No equivalent |
| **@mention resolution** | Bidirectional phone↔name via DB | One-way |
| **Channels** | 3 (WhatsApp, Telegram, Mattermost) — channel-agnostic architecture | 25 channels |
| **AI providers** | 2 (Anthropic, OpenAI Codex) — provider-agnostic architecture | 15+ providers |
| **Mobile/desktop apps** | None | iOS, Android, macOS |
| **Cron/automation** | Built-in cron with CRUD tools | Built-in cron + webhooks |
| **Subagent spawning** | Ephemeral subagents with parallel spawning | Task decomposition via child agents |
| **Agent-to-agent calls** | A2A protocol — agents can invoke other agents | No equivalent |
| **Installable skills** | Prompt-based skills from URL, GitHub, or local path | No equivalent |
| **LLM observability** | Opik tracing (prompts, responses, tool calls) + Grafana dashboards | No equivalent |

Lis wins on **depth** — cost optimization, context management, runtime flexibility, observability, and crash safety. OpenClaw wins on **breadth** — more channels, providers, and platform integrations.

## Features

### Agentic Tool Loop

The AI doesn't just generate text. It operates in a **streaming multi-turn tool loop** — calling tools, receiving results, reasoning about them, and responding — up to 10 iterations per turn. Each assistant message is sent to the user as it's produced, so you see incremental progress during complex tasks instead of waiting for a single monolithic response.

Every tool call sends a real-time notification to the chat ("🔍 Searching...", "📄 Reading file...", "🖥️ Running: git status") so you always know what the AI is doing. These notifications are configurable per-agent — turn them off for a cleaner experience, or keep them for full visibility.

### Cost & Context Optimization

Running an AI agent on a messaging platform means long-lived conversations with heavy tool use. Without active cost management, token usage explodes.

- **Two-stage context compaction** — (1) tool output pruning silently strips verbose results to bare function names when they exceed a threshold, (2) full compaction summarizes older context while keeping recent messages verbatim. Both trigger automatically based on configurable token budgets.
- **4 prompt cache breakpoints** — cache markers at system prompt, session summary, tool prune boundary, and top-level maximize Anthropic prompt cache hits. The difference between 0% and 90% cache hits is the difference between $3/day and $0.30/day.
- **Separate compaction model** — use Haiku for summarization while keeping Sonnet or Opus for conversation. Compaction cost drops by 10x.
- **Tool summarization policies** — per-tool control: `Prune` strips verbose output (file listings, search results), `Summarize` preserves valuable context (memory searches, config reads) in compaction summaries.
- **Per-message token tracking** — input, output, cache read, cache creation — stored per-message and per-session. `/status` shows real-time cache hit %, token usage, and budget utilization.

### Tools (~50 functions across 14 plugins)

### Multi-Agent

Not every conversation needs the same model, tools, or personality.

- **Named agents** with independent model, prompts, tool profiles, and compaction settings.
- **Switch agents per chat** — `/agent coding` for development tasks, `/agent default` for casual conversation. No restart, no config file edits.
- **Tool profiles** — `minimal` (read-only) → `standard` (general) → `coding` (exec + files) → `full` (everything including browser). Plus per-agent allow/deny glob patterns for fine-grained control.
- **Create and delete agents** — `/agent new research "Research Assistant"`, `/agent delete research`.
- **Runtime config editing** — change any setting mid-conversation via tools. The AI can tune its own parameters.
- **Ephemeral subagents** — spawn child agents for parallel task decomposition. Each subagent runs with its own context and reports back.
- **Agent-to-agent calls (A2A)** — agents can invoke other agents with full tool execution support.
- **Installable skills** — prompt-based skills installable from URL, GitHub repo, or local path. Enable, disable, and manage per agent.

### Security (5-layer defense-in-depth)

Mistrust by design. Each layer operates independently — compromising one doesn't bypass the others.

| Layer | Gate | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **1. ShouldRespond** | Chat-level | Enabled flag, authorized senders list, mention requirements, owner bypass |
| **2. Tool Policy** | Context visibility | Profile filter + allow/deny globs control which tools the AI can even see |
| **3. Tool Auth** | Per-tool invocation | `Open` / `OwnerOnly` / `ApprovalRequired` — checked at runtime, not just hidden |
| **4. Exec Approval** | Human gating | Allowlist patterns + async approval via reactions (👍 once, ✅ always + add to allowlist, ❌ deny) |
| **5. Workspace Sandbox** | Path boundary | Symlink-aware path validation — resolves symlink targets to prevent filesystem escape |

### Sessions & Memory

Conversations don't end when the context window fills up.

- **Linked-list sessions** — compaction creates a child session with a summary. Sessions form a navigable history, not a flat log.
- **`/resume`** — revisit any past session. If it fits the budget, load full original messages. If not, inject the summary as context. Search by session ID or by topic (pgvector semantic search on summaries).
- **Semantic memory** — explicit CRUD tools backed by pgvector embeddings with full-text search fallback. The AI creates, searches, updates, and deletes memories through natural conversation.
- **Crash-safe queue** — messages received during AI processing are persisted in PostgreSQL. On restart, they're flushed and processed. No messages lost.

### UX That Feels Native

The goal is an experience that feels like messaging a person, not operating a bot.

- **Typing indicator** — WhatsApp "typing..." shown while the AI is processing.
- **Clock reaction** — when the AI is busy and you send another message, it gets a 🕐 reaction so you know it was received. Removed after processing.
- **Message debouncing** — rapid messages are batched with a configurable delay (default 3s, per-chat override). Typing events from the user reset the timer, so the AI waits until you're done.
- **Response directives** — the AI chooses how to respond: `[QUOTE]` to quote the user's message, `NO_RESPONSE` to suppress text after a reaction, or react to specific messages by ID.
- **`/abort`** — cancel in-progress AI responses instantly. The AI stops generating, queued messages are flushed, and the chat is ready for new input.
- **Markdown → WhatsApp** — headers, bold, italic, code blocks, lists, and links automatically converted to WhatsApp's native formatting.

### Group Intelligence

Groups aren't second-class citizens. They have dedicated logic for authorization, context, and interaction.

- **3-layer mention detection** — native WhatsApp @mention, reply-to-bot (implicit mention), and configurable text triggers (comma-separated per agent, e.g., `"lis,liszinha"`).
- **Bidirectional @mention resolution** — incoming `@552731911808` → `@Alice` (the AI sees names, not numbers), outgoing `@Alice` → `@552731911808` (creates native WhatsApp @mentions). Resolved via the messages database with duplicate name disambiguation.
- **Context windowing** — keep all bot messages + last N consecutive user messages (default 5, per-chat override). Reduces noise without losing relevant context.
- **Group metadata injection** — group name and topic fetched from the WhatsApp API, injected into the system prompt so the AI knows where it is.

### Cron & Automation

- **Scheduled tasks** — create recurring jobs with cron expressions via natural conversation.
- **CRUD tools** — create, list, update, and delete scheduled tasks through the CronPlugin.
- **Background execution** — CronSchedulerService runs as a hosted service, executing tasks on schedule with owner-level auth.

### Observability

- **Opik LLM tracing** — native REST client captures full agent turns: prompts, responses, tool calls, and A2A invocations. Each conversation turn is a trace with nested spans.
- **Grafana dashboards** — pre-built dashboards for conversations, channels, database performance, reliability metrics, and error logs.
- **OpenTelemetry** — traces, metrics, and logs exported via OTLP. GenAI semantic convention tags on all AI operations. Sensitive data (bot tokens, API keys) automatically redacted from trace attributes.

### Media

- **Image/sticker understanding** — sent to Claude as multimodal content. The AI sees what you send.
- **Audio transcription** — OpenAI Whisper integration. Audio messages are transcribed and injected inline as `<Audio transcript: ...>`.
- **File sending** — the AI can send files and images back through any channel via the SendFile plugin.
- **Auto-download** — media downloaded from channel CDN automatically.

### Project Structure

```
Lis.Core          — Interfaces, configuration, utilities (no heavy deps)
Lis.Persistence   — EF Core DbContext, entities, migrations (PostgreSQL)
Lis.Agent         — Conversation orchestration, context window, compaction, sessions
Lis.Tools         — Semantic Kernel plugins (exec, fs, browser, web, memory, ...)
Lis.Providers     — AI provider implementations (Anthropic, OpenAI Codex)
Lis.Channels      — Messaging channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Mattermost)
Lis.Api           — ASP.NET Core host, composition root, Dockerfile
Lis.Tests         — xUnit test suite
```

**Provider-agnostic**: swap AI providers by implementing `IChatClient`. **Channel-agnostic**: add messaging platforms by implementing `IChannelClient`. The conversation engine knows nothing about WhatsApp, Telegram, or Anthropic.
